# Columbia Fintech Bootcamp: Module #13 Challenge

Feature Summary: Venture Funding with Deep Learning

As a risk management associate at Alphabet Soup, a venture capital firm. Alphabet Soupâ€™s business team receives many funding applications from startups every day. This team has asked to help them create a model that predicts whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.  The business team has provided a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. The goal of this challenge is to use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier model that will predict whether an applicant will become a successful business. The CSV file contains a variety of information about these businesses, including whether or not they ultimately became successful.


- Includes the following tasks:

    * Prepare the data for use on a neural network model
    * Compile and evaluate a binary classification model using a neural network
    * Optimize the neural network model

## Technologies

This project leverages python 3.9 with the following packages:
* [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) - A powerful data analysis toolkit.
* [numpy](https://numpy.org/) - A core library for scientific computing in Python
* [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) - An end-to-end open source platform for machine learning
* [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/) - A simple and efficient tools for predictive data analysis

This project leverages python 3.9 with the following packages:

Jupyter Lab 3.3.2 is required

- *Jupyter Lab is primarily used as a web-based development environment for the notebooks, code, and data associated with this project.  Its flexible interface allows users to configure and arrange workflows in data science*

## Installation Guide

Before running the application first install the following dependencies.

```python
  pip install pandas
  pip install numpy
  pip install tensorflow
  pip install sklearn
```
*Assumption made for module challenge: the* **sys** *and Path module will not be required to be explicitely called out in Installation guide section*

To run Jupyter Lab, need to install Anaconda:
* [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) - an open-source distribution of the Python
